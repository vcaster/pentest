## Raw file with dwarf file and sys map 
The dwarf and system map can be zipped and put in the folder `volatility/plugins/overlays/linux/` to create a profile. The name of the created profile can be checked with `python2 vol.py --info | grep Profile` and in my case, it was Linuxphillipx64.

We can view the bash hisory using the command `python2 vol.py --profile=Linuxphillipx64 -f ../philip-1.raw linux_bash`
* RSA private keys can be found with memdump.py. https://github.com/Crapworks/pentest/blob/master/memdump.py
* get ssh key: `python2 memdump.py philip-1.raw`

# NETWORK PCAP

## ICMP 
```
It’s Wireshark, it’s a bunch of ICMP pings, each packet’s data contents are either all ones or all zeroes. Problem is there’s two duplicate packets (request, reply) but I just need one per bit. Use Wireshark to filter for just icmp.resp_in.

Now do File → Export Packet Dissections → As JSON → Displayed.

Copy paste the JSON into https://jqplay.org and use this filter: .[]._source.layers.icmp.data."data.data".

Copy paste the result into VS code, zoom out, use the multiline cursor to get just one column of text. Find/Replace to remove newlines and replace f with 1. Paste resultant binary into Cyberchef, convert from binary (to ASCII), get flag.
