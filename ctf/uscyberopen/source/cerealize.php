<h3>The Archive</h3>
<p>Hi! We want to build an archive of every known cereal, complete with name, flavor, and brand! It's too much work
for us to do on our own, so we need your help to grow the archive!</p>
<p>Please see below for submission guidelines.</p>

<h3>Submission guidelines</h3>
<p>Since we're still in development, we don't have a fancy frontend for submitting a new cereal for the archive. Instead, just give us
a POST request with a "cereal" parameter. Just for fun, why don't you serialize it? We've open-sourced the project,
so you can see what format we're expecting by checking out the code.</p>
<p>Thanks for your interest in contributing to the cereal archive!</p>
