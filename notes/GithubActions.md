# Foreman-Ansible-Teraform
To create a GitHub Actions pipeline for Terraform, Ansible, and Foreman, you can follow these steps:

* Create a new GitHub repository for your project.
* Create a main.tf file for your Terraform configuration, a playbook file for your Ansible configuration (e.g., playbook.yml), and a Foreman configuration file (e.g., foreman.yaml).
* Add a .github/workflows directory to the root of your repository.
* In the .github/workflows directory, create a new YAML file (e.g., terraform-ansible-foreman.yml) and add the following code:

# ACT

* runs git workflow locally
* `act -l` -> list
* `act -j name` -> run
* `act -j name -v -r` -> reuse docker image

# Schedule

```
name: Scheduled Action

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *' # Run every day at midnight UTC

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

      - name: Build app
        run: |
          npm install
          npm run build
      - name: Deploy app to production
        run: |
          # deploy app to production environment
