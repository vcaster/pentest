# John Basic Syntax
```
The basic syntax of John the Ripper commands is as follows. We will cover the specific options and modifiers used as we use them.
```

`john [options] [path to file]`

`john` - Invokes the John the Ripper program

`[path to file]` - The file containing the hash you're trying to crack, if it's in the same directory you won't need to name a path, just the file.


# Automatic Cracking

John has built-in features to detect what type of hash it's being given, and to select appropriate rules and formats to crack it for you, this isn't always the best idea as it can be unreliable- but if you can't identify what hash type you're working with and just want to try cracking it, it can be a good option! To do this we use the following syntax:

`john --wordlist=[path to wordlist] [path to file]`

`--wordlist=` - Specifies using wordlist mode, reading from the file that you supply in the following path...

`[path to wordlist]` - The path to the wordlist you're using, as described in the previous task.

Example Usage:

john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash_to_crack.txt


# Identifying Hashes

Sometimes John won't play nicely with automatically recognising and loading hashes, that's okay! We're able to use other tools to identify the hash, and then set john to use a specific format. There are multiple ways to do this, such as using an online hash identifier like this one. I like to use a tool called hash-identifier, a Python tool that is super easy to use and will tell you what different types of hashes the one you enter is likely to be, giving you more options if the first one fails.

To use hash-identifier, you can just pull the python file from gitlab using: `wget https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/hash-identifier/-/raw/kali/master/hash-id.py`.

Then simply launch it with `python3 hash-identifier.py` and then enter the hash you're trying to identify- and it will give you possible formats!

# Format-Specific Cracking

Once you have identified the hash that you're dealing with, you can tell john to use it while cracking the provided hash using the following syntax:

`john --format=[format] --wordlist=[path to wordlist] [path to file]`

`--format=` - This is the flag to tell John that you're giving it a hash of a specific format, and to use the following format to crack it

`[format]` - The format that the hash is in

## Example Usage:

john --format=raw-md5 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash_to_crack.txt

A Note on Formats:

When you are telling john to use formats, if you're dealing with a standard hash type, e.g. md5 as in the example above, you have to prefix it with `raw-` to tell john you're just dealing with a standard hash type, though this doesn't always apply. To check if you need to add the prefix or not, you can list all of John's formats using `john --list=formats` and either check manually, or grep for your hash type using something like `john --list=formats | grep -iF "md5"`.

# NTHash / NTLM

NThash is the hash format that modern Windows Operating System machines will store user and service passwords in. It's also commonly referred to as "NTLM" which references the previous version of Windows format for hashing passwords known as "LM", thus "NT/LM".

# Unshadowing

John can be very particular about the formats it needs data in to be able to work with it, for this reason- in order to crack /etc/shadow passwords, you must combine it with the /etc/passwd file in order for John to understand the data it's being given. To do this, we use a tool built into the John suite of tools called unshadow. The basic syntax of unshadow is as follows:

unshadow [path to passwd] [path to shadow]

unshadow - Invokes the unshadow tool

[path to passwd] - The file that contains the copy of the /etc/passwd file you've taken from the target machine

[path to shadow] - The file that contains the copy of the /etc/shadow file you've taken from the target machine 

# Cracking
```
We're then able to feed the output from unshadow, in our example use case called "unshadowed.txt" directly into John. We should not need to specify a mode here as we have made the input specifically for John, however in some cases you will need to specify the format as we have done previously using: --format=sha512crypt

john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --format=sha512crypt unshadowed.txt
```

# Using Single Crack Mode

To use single crack mode, we use roughly the same syntax that we've used to so far, for example if we wanted to crack the password of the user named "Mike", using single mode, we'd use:

`john --single --format=[format] [path to file]`

`--single` - This flag lets john know you want to use the single hash cracking mode.

Example Usage:

`john --single --format=raw-sha256 hashes.txt`

A Note on File Formats in Single Crack Mode:

If you're cracking hashes in single crack mode, you need to change the file format that you're feeding john for it to understand what data to create a wordlist from. You do this by prepending the hash with the username that the hash belongs to, so according to the above example- we would change the file hashes.txt

# How to create Custom Rules
```
Custom rules are defined in the john.conf file, usually located in /etc/john/john.conf if you have installed John using a package manager or built from source with make and in /opt/john/john.conf on the TryHackMe Attackbox.

Let's go over the syntax of these custom rules, using the example above as our target pattern. Note that there is a massive level of granular control that you can define in these rules, I would suggest taking a look at the wiki here in order to get a full view of the types of modifier you can use, as well as more examples of rule implementation.


The first line:

[List.Rules:THMRules] - Is used to define the name of your rule, this is what you will use to call your custom rule as a John argument.

We then use a regex style pattern match to define where in the word will be modified, again- we will only cover the basic and most common modifiers here:

Az - Takes the word and appends it with the characters you define

A0 - Takes the word and prepends it with the characters you define

c - Capitalises the character positionally


These can be used in combination to define where and what in the word you want to modify.

Lastly, we then need to define what characters should be appended, prepended or otherwise included, we do this by adding character sets in square brackets [ ] in the order they should be used. These directly follow the modifier patterns inside of double quotes " ". Here are some common examples:


[0-9] - Will include numbers 0-9

[0] - Will include only the number 0

[A-z] - Will include both upper and lowercase

[A-Z] - Will include only uppercase letters

[a-z] - Will include only lowercase letters

[a] - Will include only a

[!£$%@] - Will include the symbols !£$%@


Putting this all together, in order to generate a wordlist from the rules that would match the example password "Polopassword1!" (assuming the word polopassword was in our wordlist) we would create a rule entry that looks like this:

[List.Rules:PoloPassword]

cAz"[0-9] [!£$%@]"


In order to:

Capitalise the first  letter - c

Append to the end of the word - Az

A number in the range 0-9 - [0-9]

Followed by a symbol that is one of [!£$%@]


Using Custom Rules

We could then call this custom rule as a John argument using the  --rule=PoloPassword flag.

As a full command: john --wordlist=[path to wordlist] --rule=PoloPassword [path to file]
```
# Zip2John SAME FoR RAR just interchange (use john file.txt --show)

Similarly to the unshadow tool that we used previously, we're going to be using the zip2john tool to convert the zip file into a hash format that John is able to understand, and hopefully crack. The basic usage is like this:

`zip2john [options] [zip file] > [output file]`

`[options]` - Allows you to pass specific checksum options to zip2john, this shouldn't often be necessary

`[zip file]` - The path to the zip file you wish to get the hash of

`>` - This is the output director, we're using this to send the output from this file to the...

`[output file]` - This is the file that will store the output from

Example Usage

`zip2john zipfile.zip > zip_hash.txt`

Cracking

We're then able to take the file we output from zip2john in our example use case called "zip_hash.txt" and, as we did with unshadow, feed it directly into John as we have made the input specifically for it.

`john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt zip_hash.txt`

# DES cracking

Copy Des with user `victim:rUIqncnX2yqpE:18823:0:99999:7:::` > hash
`john hash --format=descrypt`

# SSH2John

Who could have guessed it, another conversion tool? Well, that's what working with John is all about. As the name suggests ssh2john converts the id_rsa private key that you use to login to the SSH session into a hash format that john can work with. Jokes aside, it's another beautiful example of John's versatility. The syntax is about what you'd expect. Note that if you don't have ssh2john installed, you can use ssh2john.py, which is located in the /opt/john/ssh2john.py. If you're doing this, replace the `ssh2john` command with `python3 /opt/john/ssh2john.py`.

`ssh2john [id_rsa private key file] > [output file]`

`ssh2john` - Invokes the ssh2john tool

`[id_rsa private key file]` - The path to the id_rsa file you wish to get the hash of

`>` - This is the output director, we're using this to send the output from this file to the...
`[output file]` - This is the file that will store the output from

Example Usage:

`ssh2john id_rsa > id_rsa_hash.txt`
Then
`john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt id_rsa_hash.txt`
