# ideas
* script -> input LHOST Lport -> generate persistence.sh
* sniff packets over to attacker (maybe through diff protocol )
* modify core commands (try ssh -> sshpass) -> store in fake paths and
* maybe to hide (use original command (try netsat), ps > grep out your sink > pass to unsuspecting user)
