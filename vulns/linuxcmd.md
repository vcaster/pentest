# Cheat Sheet

# Simple syn
` & -> backgrounds`
` >> appends to file`
` | allows output be used in next e.g grep`
` ; works as an OR operator runs both`
` ln link files -s symbio`

# Sudo
` -u specifies user`
` -l specifies control`

* adduser <username>
* addgroup <groupname>
* usermod -a -G <groups seperated by commas> <user>

## Unzip
`gzip -dk file.gz -- k - keep`

# unzip tar

`tar -xvzf <file>`

# Processes
* `ps -ef`
* `htop`

# Find Grep
`find / | grep root.txt > file.log` 
`find / -xdev -type f -print0 2>/dev/null | xargs -0 grep -E '^[a-z0-9]{32}$' 2>/dev/null `

`grep -E -o "\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,6}\b" file.txt` email extract

# AWK
 `awk -F, '{print $3}' file.txt` password extract

# CHMOD

# sed -> stream editor
```
Sed is a stream editor.  A stream editor is used to perform basic text transformations on an input stream (a file or input from a pipeline).  While
       in some ways similar to an editor which permits scripted edits (such as ed), sed works by making only one pass over the  input(s),  and  is  conse‐
       quently more efficient.  But it is sed's ability to filter text in a pipeline which particularly distinguishes it from other types of editors.

       -n, --quiet, --silent

# Filez 
/var/log
/etc/passwd
.bashrc -> commands
/etc/*release -> sysinfo
.profile -> saves personal $PATH

# Base64 
 
 `base64 --decode <file>`

 # xxd 

 ```
 When we output the content of our Flag22, the output is in the hex format. We need to convert this is into ASCII as shown below. xxd creates the hex dump of a file and converts the hex dump back to its original binary.
 ```

 # rev
 
 `for reverse`

 # uname

 `Gets sytem information`

 # tr

`delete / squezes chars`
```
-d, --delete            delete characters in SET1, do not translate
  -s, --squeeze-repeats   replace each sequence of a repeated character
                            that is listed in the last specified SET,
                            with a single occurrence of that character
  -t, --truncate-set1     first truncate SET1 to length of SET2
      --help     display this help and exit
