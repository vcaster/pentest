# Injection

```
SQL Injection
	SQL Injection is when an attacker enters a malicious or malformed query to either retrieve or tamper data from a database. And in some cases, log into accounts.
Command Injection
	Command Injection is when web applications take input or user-controlled data and run them as system commands. An attacker may tamper with this data to execute their own system commands. This can be seen in applications that perform misconfigured ping tests. 
Email Injection
	Email injection is a security vulnerability that allows malicious users to send email messages without prior authorization by the email server. These occur when the attacker adds extra data to fields, which are not interpreted by the server correctly.

# Poison Null Byte
```
A Poison Null Byte looks like this: %00. 

Note that we can download it using the url, so we will encode this into a url encoded format.

The Poison Null Byte will now look like this: %2500. Adding this and then a .md to the end will bypass the 403 error!

Why does this work? 

A Poison Null Byte is actually a NULL terminator. By placing a NULL character in the string at a certain byte, the string will tell the server to terminate at that point, nulling the rest of the string.

# XSS attacks:
```
DOM (Special)
	DOM XSS (Document Object Model-based Cross-site Scripting) uses the HTML environment to execute malicious javascript. This type of attack commonly uses the <script></script> HTML tag.
Persistent (Server-side)
	Persistent XSS is javascript that is run when the server loads the page containing it. These can occur when the server does not sanitise the user data when it is uploaded to a page. These are commonly found on blog posts. 
Reflected (Client-side)
	Reflected XSS is javascript that is run on the client-side end of the web application. These are most commonly found when the server doesn't sanitise search data.
