# Malware analysis
`When analysing malware, it is important to consider the following:`

* Point of Entry (PoE) I.e. Was it through spam that our e-mail filtering missed and the user opened the attachment? Let's review our spam filters and train our users better for future prevention!
* What are the indicators that malware has even been executed on a machine? Are there any files, processes, or perhaps any attempt of "un-ordinary" communication?
* How does the malware perform? Does it attempt to infect other devices? Does it encrypt files or install anything like a backdoor / Remote Access Tool (RAT)?
* Most importantly - can we ultimately prevent and/or detect further infection?!

# Types

* Taregeted
* mass campaign
# Host-Based Signatures

These are generally speaking the results of execution and any persistence performed by the Malware. For example, has a file been encrypted? Has any additional software been installed? These can are two of many, many host-based signatures that are useful to know to prevent and check against further infection.

# Network-Based Signatures

At an overview, this classification of signatures are the observation of any networking communication taking place during delivery, execution and propagation. For example, in Ransomware, where has the Malware contacted for Bitcoin payments?

Such as in the case of Wannacry, looking for a large amount of "Samba" Protocol communication attempts is a great indication of infection due to its use of "Eternalblue".

There are two categories used when analysing malware, these are:

1. Static Analysis

2. Dynamic Analysis

Whilst the methods and tools used for these two categories are vastly different, they are essential in compositing an understanding of how a malware behaves.

Static Analysis.

At its brief, "Static Analysis" is used to gain a high-level abstraction of the sample - it can be fairly simple to decide if a piece of code is "malicious" or not with this method alone (but not always, this will be discussed later...). At its core, this method is of the analysis of the sample at the state it presents itself as, without executing the code.

Employing the use of techniques such as signature analysis via checksums means quick, efficient (albeit extremely brief) and safe analysis of malware.

Dynamic Analysis

This step is a lot more involved, and is where the abstraction of the sample is largely built upon. "Dynamic Analysis" essentially involves executing the sample and observing what happens. This of course is not safe. If the sample turns out to be "Ransomware" - you've now lost your files. If it is capable of propagating via traversing a network, nice...You've now just infected your Local Area Network (LAN).

Please note that these are extremely simplistic explanations of these techniques, there is a lot more involved which we will go throughout this series.
