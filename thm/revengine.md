Register me this, register me that...
The core of assembly language involves using registers to do the following: 

    Transfer data between memory and register, and vice versa
    Perform arithmetic operations on registers and data
    Transfer control to other parts of the program Since the architecture is x86-64, the registers are 64 bit and Intel has a list of 16 registers:

Initial Data Type	Suffix	Size (bytes)
Byte	b	1
Word	w	2
Double Word	 l
	4
Quad	q	8
Single Precision
	s	4
Double Precision
	l
	8

When dealing with memory manipulation using registers, there are other cases to be considered:

    (Rb, Ri) = MemoryLocation[Rb + Ri]
    D(Rb, Ri) = MemoryLocation[Rb + Ri + D]
    (Rb, Ri, S) = MemoryLocation(Rb + S * Ri]
    D(Rb, Ri, S) = MemoryLocation[Rb + S * Ri + D]



```

```

4. Read the instructions!

Some other important instructions are:

*    leaq source, destination: this instruction sets destination to the address denoted by the expression in source
*    addq source, destination: destination = destination + source
*    subq source, destination: destination = destination - source
*    imulq source, destination: destination = destination * source
 *   salq source, destination: destination = destination << source where << is the left bit shifting operator
 *   sarq source, destination: destination = destination >> source where >> is the right bit shifting operator
 *   xorq source, destination: destination = destination XOR source
 *   andq source, destination: destination = destination & source
 *   orq source, destination: destination = destination | source
```
