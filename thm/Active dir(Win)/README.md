# What is Active Directory? - 

Active Directory is a collection of machines and servers connected inside of domains, that are a collective part of a bigger forest of domains, that make up the Active Directory network. Active Directory contains many functioning bits and pieces, a majority of which we will be covering in the upcoming tasks. To outline what we'll be covering take a look over this list of Active Directory components and become familiar with the various pieces of Active Directory: 

    Domain Controllers
    Forests, Trees, Domains
    Users + Groups 
    Trusts
    Policies 
    Domain Services

All of these parts of Active Directory come together to make a big network of machines and servers. Now that we know what Active Directory is let's talk about the why?

# Why use Active Directory? -

The majority of large companies use Active Directory because it allows for the control and monitoring of their user's computers through a single domain controller. It allows a single user to sign in to any computer on the active directory network and have access to his or her stored files and folders in the server, as well as the local storage on that machine. This allows for any user in the company to use any machine that the company owns, without having to set up multiple users on a machine. Active Directory does it all for you.

Now what we know the what and the why of Active Directory let's move on to how it works and functions.

# Datastore

The Active Directory Data Store holds the databases and processes needed to store and manage directory information such as users, groups, and services. Below is an outline of some of the contents and characteristics of the AD DS Data Store:

    Contains the NTDS.dit - a database that contains all of the information of an Active Directory domain controller as well as password hashes for domain users
    Stored by default in %SystemRoot%\NTDS
    accessible only by the domain controller

# Forest Overview -

A forest is a collection of one or more domain trees inside of an Active Directory network. It is what categorizes the parts of the network as a whole.

The Forest consists of these parts which we will go into farther detail with later:

*    Trees - A hierarchy of domains in Active Directory Domain Services
*    Domains - Used to group and manage objects 
*    Organizational Units (OUs) - Containers for groups, computers, users, printers and other OUs
*    Trusts - Allows users to access resources in other domains
*    Objects - users, groups, printers, computers, shares
*    Domain Services - DNS Server, LLMNR, IPv6
*    Domain Schema - Rules for object creation

# Groups Overview - 

Groups make it easier to give permissions to users and objects by organizing them into groups with specified permissions. There are two overarching types of Active Directory groups: 

    Security Groups - These groups are used to specify permissions for a large number of users
    Distribution Groups - These groups are used to specify email distribution lists. As an attacker these groups are less beneficial to us but can still be beneficial in enumeration

# Default Security Groups - 

There are a lot of default security groups so I won't be going into too much detail of each past a brief description of the permissions that they offer to the assigned group. Here is a brief outline of the security groups:

    Domain Controllers - All domain controllers in the domain
    Domain Guests - All domain guests
    Domain Users - All domain users
    Domain Computers - All workstations and servers joined to the domain
    Domain Admins - Designated administrators of the domain
    Enterprise Admins - Designated administrators of the enterprise
    Schema Admins - Designated administrators of the schema
    DNS Admins - DNS Administrators Group
    DNS Update Proxy - DNS clients who are permitted to perform dynamic updates on behalf of some other clients (such as DHCP servers).
    Allowed RODC Password Replication Group - Members in this group can have their passwords replicated to all read-only domain controllers in the domain
    Group Policy Creator Owners - Members in this group can modify group policy for the domain
    Denied RODC Password Replication Group - Members in this group cannot have their passwords replicated to any read-only domain controllers in the domain
    Protected Users - Members of this group are afforded additional protections against authentication security threats. See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=298939 for more information.
    Cert Publishers - Members of this group are permitted to publish certificates to the directory
    Read-Only Domain Controllers - Members of this group are Read-Only Domain Controllers in the domain
    Enterprise Read-Only Domain Controllers - Members of this group are Read-Only Domain Controllers in the enterprise
    Key Admins - Members of this group can perform administrative actions on key objects within the domain.
    Enterprise Key Admins - Members of this group can perform administrative actions on key objects within the forest.
    Cloneable Domain Controllers - Members of this group that are domain controllers may be cloned.
    RAS and IAS Servers - Servers in this group can access remote access properties of users

    here are two types of trusts that determine how the domains communicate. I'll outline the two types of trusts below: 

    Directional - The direction of the trust flows from a trusting domain to a trusted domain
    Transitive - The trust relationship expands beyond just two domains to include other trusted domains


    Kerberos - The default authentication service for Active Directory uses ticket-granting tickets and service tickets to authenticate users and give users access to other resources across the domain.
    NTLM - default Windows authentication protocol uses an encrypted challenge/response protocol

    Cloud Security Overview - 

The best way to show you how the cloud takes security precautions past what is already provided with a physical network is to show you a comparison with a cloud Active Directory environment: 
Windows Server AD	Azure AD
LDAP	Rest APIs
NTLM	OAuth/SAML
Kerberos	OpenID
OU Tree	Flat Structure
Domains and Forests	Tenants
Trusts	Guests
