# Tools

Great tools exist that allow us to search for user accounts across social media platforms. Sites, 
such as `https://namechk.com/`, `https://whatsmyname.app/` and `https://namecheckup.com/` will identify other possible accounts quickly for us. 
Tools, such as `https://github.com/WebBreacher/WhatsMyName` and `ttps://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock` do this as well.
Simply enter a username, hit search, and comb through the results. It's that easy!
